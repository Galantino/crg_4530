### Group 6 (Ben Gassaway, Anna Lawrence, Christopher Galantino)
## Laboratory 4 Lab Report



##Introduction and Objectives
Our firm was hired in order to study why a specific species was dropping off. We have observed that there has been increased rainfall in the area so we believe the species drop off has something to do with the pH of surrounding water. Acid precipitation is caused by a chemical reaction that begins when compounds like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide are released into the air. These substances rise into the atmosphere where they mix and react with water, oxygen, and other chemicals to form more acidic pollutants, such as acidic precipitation. The ecological effects of acid rain can be seen in aquatic environments, such as streams, lakes, and marshes where it can be harmful to certain ecosystems. We hypothesized that the acid rain will have a non-negligible impact on the natural pH of the lake. The team sought to quantify the scope with which the natural pH is impacted by influx of acid rain. Lakes are most vulnerable to acidification due to their downwind location, insoluble bedrock surroundings, high runoff to infiltration ratio and low watershed to lake surface area. Acid neutralizing capacity, or ANC, measures a lakes susceptibility to acidification, of the lake water. In the presence of acid rain input, lakes with a high ANC will maintain a neutral pH whereas lake with ANC lower than the acid input will not maintain a neutral pH.

##Procedures

####Lab 3
For Lab 3, the experimental apparatus used consisted of an acid rain storage reservoir, peristaltic pump, and lake. The pH of the lake was monitored using a pH probe connected to a signal-conditioning box that was connected to the ProCoDA II hardware and software. We set up our experiment by first, making sure all of the parameters inputted into ProCoDA II software were correct and second, setting up the pH probe by rinsing it with DI water and calibrating it. Three buffer solutions with a known pH were used to calibrate the pH probe, red=4.0, yellow=7.0, and blue=10.0. After rinsing the pH probe, it was placed first into the red buffer and stirred gently while waiting for pH on the ProCoDA II to stabilize. Once stabilized, the probe was rinsed DI water and the process was repeated for the yellow and blue buffer solutions. Once calibration was done, the experiment was set up. This was set up specifically so that the “acid rain” is pumped directly into the lake. The pump was preset to give desired flow rate of 267 mL/min based on the size of pump tubing selected. The tubing sized used was #17, so RPM was set to (267 mL/min) / (2.8 mL/rev) = 95.4 RPM. Outflow was also set to approximately 4 L. Once all of the set up was done, the lake was filled with reverse osmosis water and placed on top of a magnetic stirrer with a stir bar.  1 mL of bromocresol green indicator solution was added to the lake. 623 mg of NaHCO3 was then added to the lake. After the lake was well stirred, a 100 mL sample was taken from the lake labeled with the time of the sample (which = 0 min). The pH of the effluent was continuously measured. This was repeated 4 times at 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes and labeled respectively. After the 20‑minute sample, the flow rate was measured by collecting effluent in a beaker for 30 seconds and then measuring the volume collected by using the mass of the water in the lake. This entire experiment was repeated, however, the lake was not mixed.

Because it wasn't mixed properly, the pH trend did not track as tightly as the effect should have been displayed. This was due to the uneven distribution of the carbonate in the reservoir. The ANC appeared to be buffering the solution well, but after one residence time, pH dropped dramatically.

Furthermore, the ANC is skewed and does not signify the exponential decay. This is a trend that is consistent with our first set of data.  

###Lab 4 Questions required of us (**in progress**)

####1
Plot the titration curve of the t=0 sample with 0.05 N HCl (plot pH as a function of titrant volume). Label the equivalent volume of titrant. Label the 2 regions of the graph where pH changes slowly with the dominant reaction that is occurring. (Place labels with the chemical reactions on the graph in the pH regions where each reaction is occurring.) Note that in a third region of slow pH change no significant reactions are occurring (added hydrogen ions contribute directly to change in pH).

```python
file = pd.read_csv('lab4_t0_trial1and2.csv')
array = np.array(file)
V_titrant = array[6:17,0]*u.mL
pH = array[6:17,1]
Ve = 0.739305 #mL
x1 = 0.2
y1 = 6.721113
x2 = 0.8
y2 = 4.065912

def slope(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    m = 0
    b = (x2 - x1)
    d = (y2 - y1)
    if b != 0:
        m = (d)/(b)

    return m

pH_equiv = -slope(x1, y1, x2, y2)*Ve
pH_equiv
plt.figure()

plt.plot(V_titrant,pH)
plt.plot(Ve,0, 'ko', label = 'Equivalent Volume' )

plt.axvline(x=0.0, color = 'g', label = 'Reaction 1')
plt.axvline(x=0.1, color = 'g')
plt.axvline(x=0.11, color = 'blue', label = 'Reaction 2')


plt.axvline(x=0.2, color = 'blue')
plt.axvline(x=0.21, color = 'pink', label = 'Reaction 3')
plt.axvline(x=1, color = 'pink')

plt.legend(loc='upper right')
plt.plot
plt.xlabel('Volume of titrant added (mL)')
plt.ylabel('pH')
plt.show()

```


####2

Prepare a Gran plot using the data from the titration curve of the t=0 sample. Use linear regression on the linear region or simply draw a straight line through the linear region of the curve to identify the equivalent volume. Compare your calculation of Ve with that was calculated by ProCoDA.

```python
from scipy import stats

V_titrant = array[6:17,0]
V_sample = 48.964500

pH_array = np.zeros(11)
V_array = np.zeros(11)

for i in range(0,11):
  pH_array[i] = float(pH[i])

pH_array
for i in range(0,11):
  V_array[i] = float(V_titrant[i])

V_array

Hconc_array = 10**(-pH_array)
Hconc_array
def F1(V_sample,V_titrant,pH):
  return (V_sample + V_titrant)/V_sample*Hconc_array
#Create an array of the F1 values.
F1_data = F1(V_sample,V_array,pH_array)
#By inspection I guess that there are 4 good data points in the linear region.
N_good_points = 4
#use scipy linear regression. Note that the we can extract the last n points from an array using the notation [-N:]
slope, intercept, r_value, p_value, std_err = stats.linregress(V_array[-N_good_points:],F1_data[-N_good_points:])
#reattach the correct units to the slope and intercept.
intercept = intercept*u.mole/u.L
slope = slope*(u.mole/u.L)/u.mL
V_eq = -intercept/slope
V_titrant = V_array*u.mL
x=[V_eq.magnitude,V_titrant[-1].magnitude]
y=[0,(V_titrant[-1]*slope+intercept).magnitude]
#Now plot the data and the linear regression
plt.plot(V_titrant, F1_data,'o')
plt.plot(x, y,'r')
plt.xlabel('Titrant Volume (mL)')
plt.ylabel('Gran function (mole/L)')
plt.legend(['data'])

plt.show()

```

The equivalent volume calculated by ProCoDA was 0.739305 mL. This linear regression analysis produced a value of .71067 mL. These numbers are exceptionally similar as expected.

####3

Plot the measured ANC of the lake on the same graph as was used to plot the conservative, volatile, and nonvolatile ANC models (see questions 2 to 5 of the Acid Precipitation and Remediation of an Acid Lake lab). Did the measured ANC values agree with the conservative ANC model?
