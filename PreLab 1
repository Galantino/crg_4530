##Pre Lab 1
1) Contact lenses are hazardous in the lab
because they may hold chemical vapors, prevent the removal of
foreign material, and prove difficult to remove in a splashing incident.

2) The minimum information needed on the label for each chemical is the full
chemical name, concentration, and date prepared. Right-To-Know labels are required
if a chemical is deemed as a hazardous material by the definition provided by OSHA.

3) It is important to label a bottle even if it contains just distilled water
because it adds a sense of mystery for those who don't know it's distilled water.
This leads to disposal issues and unwanted stress.

4) a) ScienceLab.com created this SDS

   b) The solubility of sodium nitrate in water is 92.1 g/100 ml @ 25 deg C
    or 180 g/100 ml @ 100 deg C

   c) Sodium nitrate is NOT carcinogenic

   d) The LD50 oral rat is 1267 mg/kg.

   e) I would have to ingest (86 kg)(1267 mg/kg) = 108,962 mg in order to
    have a 50% chance of death.

   f) Refer to the following math

```python
from aide_design.play import*
MW = 84.9947
ingest_L50 = 108962.0/1000.0
req_Vol = ingest_L50/MW
print(req_Vol)
```

   g) As for chronic effects, the substance may be toxic to blood. Repeated or
      prolonged exposure to the substance can produce target organs damage

5) First, make sure all your chemicals are properly labeled. Ensure that your lab space
  is cleared and your hands are thoroughly washed. If you have an experiment running,
  let someone in the lab know you'll be doing so.
